## Low Level Language

#### Machine Level Language
- Written according to the `system architecture`
- Execution is `fast`. No need of compilation
- Hard to understand by humans
- Programs are `not portable`, because of different instruction set sizes



#### Assembly Level Language
- Readable than Machine Level
- Makes use of symbols and Mnemonics
- `Assembler` converts this code into `machine code`.
- `Slower` than `Machine level`
- `Dependent` on Computer Architecture: Assembly level is specifically designed for specific system.

## High Level Language
- Close to humans
- Far from systems
- `Slower` than `Low Level` Language
- `Readable`
- Compiled / Interpreted Language 
- Nearly dependent(Independent) of System Architecture
