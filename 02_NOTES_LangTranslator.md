#### `1. Assembler`
- Converts Assembly level language to Machine Code


#### `2. Compiler`
- HLL to Machine Code
- Converts entire program before execution into Object Code / Machine Code
- Errors after the conversion to object code
- Source Code is needed only once to generate Machine code and exe file
- Ex: C, C++, C#

#### `3. Interpreter`
