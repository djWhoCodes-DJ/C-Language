#### 1. Programming
- Computers are used to perform any computational tasks. 
- To make computer work, we provide it with `set of instructions`. 
- These `set of instructions` are known as `programs`.

#### 2. Need Of High Level Language
- Low level langauges are machine specific
- Are not portable. Cannot be ported to another machine directly.
- Different sizes if instruction bits leades to code modification.

#### 3. Introduction
- Developed by `Dennis Ritchie`.
- In Bell Labs.
- Before `C`, we had `B langauge`.
- `Unix OS` was written in `B` language, and to overcome some limitations we used `C`.
- `C is a system programming language`: It means many systems are written in C langauge. Ex: Oracle, Android libraries, Device Drivers etc
- `Compiled Language` : C program -> Compiler -> Object Code
